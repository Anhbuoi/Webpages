			<h2 class="txtFormat">Career Goals</h2>
				<p>I will be graduating with an Associates of Computer Science, May of 2017.
				I want to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science while working as a developer.
				I don't really have a preference. I know whatever role I get as long it is with codes, I will soar.
				Whatever company that hires me, will see my potential.
				I work hard and efficiently.
				Programming is not just a job to me, it is my PASSION!
				I love everything about it.
				I want to work in every aspect of developing.
				I would love to develop my own language one day.
				</p>
