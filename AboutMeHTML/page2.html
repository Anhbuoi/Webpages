			<h2 class="txtFormat">Programming</h2>
				<p>The programming languages that I am fluent in is PHP, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, MySql, and Git.
				I love everything about programming.
				I don't just program for the college but I like to do it as a hobby.
				I would program for hours without knowing it.
				I have only been programming for only for two years but
				have learned to program many things.
				I love that programming can be self-taught or you can go to school
				to program.

			<h2 class="txtFormat">Golf</h2>
				<p>I have played golf as long as I've been programming.
				I have been playing golf for two years now.
				I am a 12 handicap. I was a 8 at one point.
				I started playing because my father-in-law loved playing
				and wanted to get me playing it with him as well.
